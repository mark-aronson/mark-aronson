## Hi there üëã

I'm Mark Aronson (he/him), a bioengineer turned computational modeler with a passion for advancing performance and equity in the U.S. healthcare system by improving healthcare policy through an iterative design process of theory- and data-driven modeling. 

üíª Currently, I serve as a Data Scientist at the NIH's [SCHARE](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/schare/) program, housed within the [National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/). 

ü•º I previously completed my Ph.D. in the [Sgro Lab](https://sgrolab.com/) at Boston University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and a short Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/). 

### Some of my past academic work

‚ûï As a trained engineer, back-of-the-envelope calculations are a critical tool for gaining a quantitative intuition for any system. These estimates can even go so far as to be a gut check for new phenoemena, which is exactly how I used them in this [paper](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E21-03-0096). By deriving simple, theory-based equations, I was able to provide a quantitative validation on a novel stress fiber phenomena discovered in the Sgro Lab. You can check out the underlying calculations in this [repo](https://github.com/sgrolab/ventralsfpaper). 

üîÅ Research reproducibility is one of the most compelling reasons for using scripted programming for data analysis in science. I streamlined the model code and reproduced all the results for an upcoming publication from the Sgro Lab which you can find in this [repo](https://github.com/sgrolab/dictymodels).
