## Hi, hi! 👋

🏥I'm Mark Aronson (he/him), a bioengineer turned computational modeler with a passion for advancing performance and equity in the U.S. healthcare system by improving healthcare policy through an iterative design process of theory- and data-driven modeling. 

💻 Currently, I serve as a Data Scientist at the NIH's [SCHARE](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/schare/) program, housed within the [National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/). 

🥼 I previously completed my Ph.D. in the [Sgro Lab](https://sgrolab.com/) at Boston University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and followed the lab for a short Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/). 

### What I'm up to now

As a member of the SCHARE team, I support the platform across a few areas:

🛠️ I support the development of the [SCHARE Data Repository](https://schare-repository.nimhd.nih.gov/), where public bugs are reported and tracked [here](https://github.com/NIH-ScHARe/SDR-Public). 

👨‍🏫 I help design curricula and training materials for the data science training [seminar series](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/schare/think-a-thons.html) run by the SCHARE team, which you can view on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh45KKtZkG6jyqFfjoYI1mUF93OZU8_51). 

📊 I provide data science and machine learning expertise to researchers performing health outcomes research on the cloud platform [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/). 


### Some of my past academic work

➕ As a trained engineer, back-of-the-envelope calculations are a critical tool for gaining a quantitative intuition for any system. These estimates can even go so far as to be a gut check for new phenoemena, which is exactly how I used them in this [paper](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E21-03-0096). By deriving simple, theory-based equations, I was able to provide a quantitative validation on a novel stress fiber phenomena discovered in the Sgro Lab. You can check out the underlying calculations in this [repo](https://github.com/sgrolab/ventralsfpaper). 

🔁 Research reproducibility is one of the most compelling reasons for using scripted programming for data analysis in science. I streamlined the model code and reproduced all the results for an upcoming publication from the Sgro Lab which you can find in this [repo](https://github.com/sgrolab/dictymodels). 

🧫 How to use engineering design principles to understand and program biology is the main reason I went to graduate school, and an idea I became further entranced by the more I studied it. I led the writing of a current opinion [piece](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468451120300465) on strategies of using molecular noise as an engineering design principle for multicellular systems and contributed to a [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952122001392) of synthetic multicellularity with members of the Sgro Lab.
